            They did an excellent job and were very respectful of my time, space and family.

            I found them in the local yellow pages when I needed to find a pest control company to deal with mice. 
            Not only did Trevor successfully handle the situation, 
            but he was courteous, professional, and very much a calming influence. 
            This is a small family owned business, and a truly local company.

            Always provide excellent recommendations for anything they observe e.g. rotted wood house trim, 
            evidence of other insect pests, foundation cracks, etc. 
            Would not hesitate to use them again for any pest control needs.
